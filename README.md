This project was developed as part of the Prototyping course, aiming to create a comprehensive movie database application. The primary goal was to demonstrate the integration of various technologies and frameworks to construct a fully functional web application.

Key Features and Technologies:

- **Database**: MongoDB was chosen for its flexibility and scalability, making it an ideal choice for handling the complex data structures required by a movie database.
- **Frontend Development**: The application's user interface was built using Svelte, a modern framework known for its reactivity and performance benefits. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were utilized to craft a responsive and intuitive design, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Backend Development**: Java was used to develop the backend, providing a robust and secure foundation for the application's server-side logic. This choice was made to leverage Java's extensive libraries and support for object-oriented programming principles.

Overall, this project showcases the ability to combine multiple technologies to create a dynamic and interactive movie database application. It demonstrates proficiency in full-stack development, from database management with MongoDB to frontend interactivity with Svelte, and solid backend construction using Java.
